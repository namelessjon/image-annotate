# Image Annotate

Simple python script for adding some annotations to images

## What?

This script uses pyexiv to let you set some tags on images -- title, artist, description of the work, a source url, and tags/keywords.

It can be used from the commandline, but can also present a very simple gui app.

It was written partly to learn about GUI, and partly to scratch an itch for annotating artwork I find online.
